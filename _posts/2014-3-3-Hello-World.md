##Why a "Why Metis ?"-blog :##

~~Since this blog probably would never have existed if not for Metis, I thought naturally the first blog should be dedicated to Metis.~~

Ok fine, I think the strongest reason is that after three weeks at Metis, I am loving it. So I just wanna talk about it.

###Disclaimer###
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student at Metis, so obviously I am affiliated with Metis. However, everything that is written here are my and only my own opinions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not told(/paid/forced/threaten... ;P) to write by anyone (but myself of course).

##Reasons why I think Mestis is one of the best decisions I ever made:##


* __Before Metis :__ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many data-scientists-wanna-be, I went through the process of finding which program would be best for me. Even though data science is still relatively new field, there are many choices, such as : NYU data science program, Berkely data science online program, Data Incubator... and Metis.
So let's get right on to my selection process:
		
1. Metis vs Berkeley program : 

This is quite an easy choice for me since I do not trust to put $60,000 for an online program.

It might work for many people, but for me, the ability to be able to ask a question even when I am vague about the question is crucially important. By "vague about the question", I mean sometimes, I come across a topic and I feel like can't quite graps the big picture. And to understand the big picture better, the best way for me is to have a conversation full of questions, in which some question will be based on the answer of my instructor/TA for my previous question. I don't think you( or I) can do it effectively/efficiently on a message board. 

So no, no online program for me.

		
2. Metis vs a 2-3 years in school program (NYU, Columbia,...):

This is actually quite a tough choice. I do like to learn all my topics thoroughly, with proof, with explaination how one come up with such a formula. And this obviously can't be done at a 3 months program as Metis. I do think these programs are great. 

But even if I get to choose again, I will still choose Metis, for couple of reason:
 * Time: It will take 2-3 years to finish these program. 
Data Science is seeing its popularity on the rise right now. With such popularity, within 2-3 years, the job market for this field will be extremly competitive. In stead of being in school learning theory, I rather be in the field learning real life experience. I think enriching my skills through the job than through text book will place me higher in the competitive scale 2 year from now.

* Money: Metis costs $14,000 ($12,000 for women, hurray!!!) and 3 month of living expense. These in school program cost at least $60,000 and 2-3 years living expense. Enough said.

 * Personal preference : I have been in school for quite a while. I think it's time for me to try something different (new experience is always a very good thing) 	

3. Mestis vs Data Incubator:

Data Incubator is quite a famous program (well, at least it appear in the newspaper). It is a 7 weeks long program, and is free for its fellows. Sound great, isn't it? It is great, definitely. Just not for me.

I think there is "short", and there is "too short". Besides having a background in math (Master), I was only efficient at coding Maple, which if you look at all the job advertising requirement, Maple is no where to be found. I know that I need to learn a new programming language (Python), as well as all the basic skills for being a data scientis. And 7 weeks is just **too short**

I think deciding between these two programs does come down to knowing your own ability. (And also where you get accepted to.)
