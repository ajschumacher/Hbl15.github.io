title: Why Metis? - A thorough analysis (Part 1).

![Question Mark](/images/question.jpg)


## Why would I write a "Why Metis?" blog:

<strike>Since this blog probably would never have existed if not for Metis, I thought naturally the first blog should be dedicated to Metis.</strike>

Ok fine, I think the strongest reason is that after three weeks at Metis, I am loving it. So I just wanna talk about it.


### Disclaimer

I am a student at Metis, so obviously I am affiliated with Metis. However, the opinions written here are mine and mine alone.

I was not told (/paid/forced/threatened... ;P) to write this by anyone (but myself of course).


##Reasons why I think Metis is one of the best decisions I ever made:


* __Before Metis:__

Like many data-scientists-wanna-bes, I went through the process of finding which program would be best for me. Even though data science is still a relatively new field, there are many choices, such as the NYU data science program, the Berkeley data science online program, Data Incubator... and Metis. So let's get right to my selection process:

1. Metis vs. the Berkeley program:

This is quite an easy choice for me since I am not comfortable paying $60,000 for an online program.

It might work for many people, but for me, the ability to ask a question even when I am vague about the question is crucially important. By "vague about the question", I mean sometimes, I come across a topic and I feel like can't quite grasp the big picture. And to understand the big picture better, the best way for me is to have a conversation full of questions, in which some questions will be based on previous questions' answers from my instructor/TA. I don't think you (or I) can do this effectively/efficiently on a message board.

So no, no online program for me.


2. Metis vs. a 2-3 years in-person program (NYU, Columbia,...):

This is actually quite a tough choice. I do like to learn all my topics thoroughly, with proofs, with explanations about how one comes up with such a formula. And this obviously can't be done in a 3 months program as Metis. I do think these programs are great.

But even if I get to choose again, I will still choose Metis, for couple of reason:

*Time:*

It will take 2-3 years to finish these program.

Data Science is seeing its popularity on the rise right now. With such popularity, within 2-3 years, the job market for this field will be extremly competitive. Instead of being in school learning theory, I would rather be in the field learning through real life experience. I think enriching my skills on the job than through text books will place me higher in the competitive scale 2 years from now.

*Money:*

Metis costs $14,000 ($12,000 for women, hurray!!!) and 3 months of living expense. These in school programs cost at least $60,000 and 2-3 years living expenses. Enough said.

*Personal preference :*

I have been in school for quite a while. I think it's time for me to try something different (new experiences are always a very good thing).


3. Metis vs Data Incubator:

Data Incubator is quite a famous program (well, at least it appeared in the newspaper). It is a 7-week-long program, and is free for its fellows. Sounds great, doesn't it? It is great, definitely. Just not for me.

I think there is "short", and there is "too short". Besides having a background in math (Masters), I was only efficient at coding Maple, and if you look at all the job advertising requirements, Maple is nowhere to be found. I knew that I needed to learn a new programming language (Python), as well as all the basic skills for being a data scientis. And 7 weeks is just **too short**.

I think deciding between these programs does come down to knowing your own ability. (And also where you get accepted to.)
