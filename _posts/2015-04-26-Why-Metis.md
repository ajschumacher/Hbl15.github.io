title: Why Metis? - A thorough analysis (Part 2).

![Question Mark](/images/question.jpg)

##Why I write a "Why Metis ?" blog :##

<strike>Since this blog probably would never have existed if not for Metis, I thought naturally the first blog should be dedicated to Metis.</strike>

Ok fine, I think the strongest reason is that after three weeks at Metis, I am loving it. So I just wanna talk about it.

This is part two of the same post that I write on the same day, but I break it down into two post so that it's easier to read (and scare my reader less)

###Disclaimer###
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student at Metis, so obviously I am affiliated with Metis. However, everything that is written here are my and only my own opinions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not told(/paid/forced/threaten... ;P) to write by anyone (but myself of course).

##Reasons why I think Metis is one of the best decisions I ever made:##

*__After three weeks at Metis:__

I find myself exhauted, sleep-deprived yet bubbling with happiness and excitement. How do I love Metis? Let me count the ways:

1. I love how I am surrounded by highly motivated yet nice people:

    Since the tution is not a small amount, and it's not like the program will give you a degree like in school, everyone here __wants to be here__. And it shows.

    Class starts at 9am. Lecture lasts about 1-2 hours in the morning, together with some small exercises lead by teachers. Afternoon is used to work on whatever project/challenge that you decide to work on. Officially, class ends at 5pm. However, it almost impossible to find anyone who leaves class before 8pm. My normal leaving time is around 8-9pm, but that is because I have to take a one hour train back to New Jersey, many classmates I know don't leave until 10-11pm.

    We are by no mean forced to stay. There is no grade, no fail or pass, techincally, no reason why we have to stay. We all stay because we __want__ to, not have to. We stay __purely just to learn__. It's a great environment to be in if you want to learn, surpising how that's really hard to find nowaday.

    If I have a question, I can ask anyone around and they will try their best to help me. But even more than that, people come and ask if they can help you even before you have to ask. I missed class for one day, and when I came back to class the next days, I was surrounded by people explaining to me what I missed and what I could do to catch up.

    I do love it, Metis and my classmates.

2.  I love my teachers: 

    I do want to avoid sounding like an "apple polisher" ( a funny term I learn from my fun classmate). But I don't think it right to talk about Metis without taking about our instructors. Why? Because they are superman/superwoman LOL.

    As mention above, class officically ends at 5pm. So techinically, most teacher we know will leave when class ends. Well, not teachers at Metis. Teacher stays up to 7pm (and quite often, many hours later) to help with anything you need. But that's not all, you can easily post up you question online at 11pm, and still get an answer 15 mins later. (I truly meant __11pm+__!!!)

    Have a question working on your project in the weekend? No problem, ask on the class website, most likely you will get an answer within the same day (or same hour... ^__^)

    I don't know they ever rest. I am not sure how they do it. Answer my most riddiculous questions or walking me through the same process as many times as I need it with the undiminishing patience unexplainable to me... To me, they are simply... not human ... But like Clark Kent or Peter Parker, they are good to have around.

    Oh, and they can answer any of your question to your satisfaction (or at least I have not been able to find a question they can't answer.) Which is great! (by the way, I don't consider "Can you solve the Riemman Hypothesis for me?" a fair question.)

3.  I love how we behave like Nike slogan : __JUST DO IT__

    Week one: One day after first learning Python, we already had our first project to work on, and to be present on Friday of that same week. (@___@;)is exactly how I feel. But I didn't have time to fear, to worry. I just jumped in and worked on it.

    I struggled through every pieces of that project, but I learnt, and by the end of week one, python seems like a close friend.

    Week two and three: we learnt web scraping & linear regression on top of python and we had to present our Luther project at the end of week three. 

    Web scraping? What is it? Linear regression? Huh? (@___@;;) 

    Well, by the end of week three, each of us have scrap at least a thousand websites.PLot your data? Check! Find your best fit model? Check ! Cross validation? Check!...

    Here at metis, you don't just sit there I wonder if you can do a project. You __just do it__. And from there you learn.

    To be honest, when I read the poem on Metis website, I thought it was a little bit cheesy (haha, ;p). But by now, I have never feel like there is any poem that could describe my feelings better. 

    ```
    We strive, we sweet, we swear.
    We go the extra mile.
    We stage, we fail.
    We try again. Get it right.
    We learn. Connect. Come together

    ```
    Sometimes, I can hear the poem singing through my vein. Here at Metis, I know, I feel and I live through each sentence of the poem. And I am glad!

4.  Last but not least: I love our managers.

    I think of our program manager and talent manager as Santa Claus:

    Beer and popcorn after our big presentation? Will be there even before you think to ask. 

    Don't have your bussiness cards? No worries, it has already been taken cared of.  

    Which meet up/talk event should I go to? Don't have time to look? No worries, your manager will send out emails to let you know about all the cool thing that is happening, as well as bringing great speaker to Metis for you.

    Not sure how to write your resume or get your linked in account ready? Don't worry, your manager will walk you through it.

    Our lovely managers not only save us tons of time of stuffs that we, data scientist (or maybe just me), are reluctant to deal with, but they also make Metis super fun beyond the classroom. They make going to Metis a better experience than any class you can take in school. They are, to me, just simply as indispensable as Santa Claus to children :D.
