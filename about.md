## Quick facts:

I am an aspiring data scientist and math enthusiast. I am finishing up my master of math at Rugers University as well as studying at Metis Data Science Boot camp. 

## Random facts about me:

* I am a white water rafting guide for ICO San Francisco Bay Chapter.

* I still don't know how to swim though.

* I jumped out an airplane at 13000ft.

* I piloted both an airplane and helicopter before (but I am definitely not the one you run to for help if 2012 happen...)

* I just passed beginner level at horse riding (not sure if such a thing is properly defined though)

* I owned/rode a motorcycle (Honda CBR) for 2 years.

* I am currently in love with mountain biking instead.

* I can't make the same dish taste the same twice.

* I like traveling and I do road trip about twice every year, spanning 7-21 days. My favorite time span for a trip is actually 14 days because I am "secretly" also very much a home person.

* I love graph theory and combinatorics. So don't ask me to help you split the bill at the restaurant, I don't deal much with number...

* I don't have a sweet tooth. I have a salty tooth.

* I don't like big chunk of meat, so no steak, meat loaf please. 

* I am terrible at running.
